        A NOTE TO THE MOTH WHO ATE MY SWEATER
        <br />
        I hope that you are feeling better now that you are full of sweater.
        <br />
        But, frankly, don't you think it's rude to use my clothes as common
        food?
        <br />I'd rather share my bread and rolls than deal with sweaters full
        of holes. <br />The next time you intend to dine on sweaters that are
        clearly mine, <br />I must insist -- call you to task -- <br />don't
        take a bite unless you ask. <br />By now, I think you surely know <br />
        the answer is a big, loud, <br />
